        <h2>A Brief History of Chess</h2>
        <p>
            Chess is one of the oldest and most strategic board games in the world, with origins tracing back to the 6th century in India. Known as Chaturanga, it evolved as it spread to Persia, becoming Shatranj, and later reached Europe, where it underwent significant changes to form the modern game we recognize today. Over the centuries, chess has captivated minds with its complexity and has been a battlefield for countless legendary players. The game has not only been a source of entertainment but also a tool for developing critical thinking and strategic planning.
